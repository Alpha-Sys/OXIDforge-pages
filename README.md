# OXIDforge pages
Change several pages on [OXIDforge.org](http://oxidforge.org) by sending a pull request to this repository. You don't even have to have an account on OXIDforge.org in order to do that.

This is especially interesting, if several people have to do only small changes on a page like http://oxidforge.org/en/extension-acronyms.
